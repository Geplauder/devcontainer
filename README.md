# Geplauder Development Container

This repository provides a fully functional Geplauder instance, ready for development.

It is based on Visual Studio Code's [Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## Usage

To get started, simply clone this repository and open the workspace file in VS Code.
```bash
code geplauder.code-workspace
```

It should now prompt you to re-open this folder in a devcontainer.

After VS Code is done setting up the container, refer to the respective project repositories for more information on running them.
